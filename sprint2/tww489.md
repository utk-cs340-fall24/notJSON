# Sprint 2

Landon Boone, git-id: landon-boone2001, group: notJSON
### What you planned to do

    Planned to add functionality of running server until user  chooses to disconnect, send a file from a client to the server, and allow functionality of the server to compile the file (if required) and run the file, returning the results to the client in C. Also fix some issues with message adding null characters to a packet sent, as well as refactor some code to be mroe portabke.

### What you did not do

    Run the server in a loop until the user chooses to disconnect.


### What problems you encountered

Mainly issues encountered were with fixing the null character count for sending files, preventing c files sent (as well as any other language) to be detected as a readable and compilable c file. 


### Issues you worked on

[72](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/notJSON/issues/72) [75](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/notJSON/issues/75)

### Files you worked on

- helloplus/CServer/lin/server.c
- helloplus/Cserver/src/clientTest.c
- helloplus/CServer/src/serverTest.c
- helloplus/CServer/src/sendFile.c
- helloplus/CServer/src/receivedFile.c (file sent from server)

## What you accomplished

Refactored some previous code to become more portable. Fixed some issues involving the transmission of a package between a server and a client by having the client send an initial message of the file size transmitted. Allow the transfer of a file to be sent from a client to a server. Allow the server to compile and execute programs sent by a client, returning the results to the client.
