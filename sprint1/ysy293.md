# Sprint 1

Jason West, ysy293 | notJSON

### What I planned to do
- Planned to write a simple web server in JavaScript (Issue 26): https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/notJSON/issues/26
- Planned to parse the xml schemafile into a Python datastructure, specifically the dataclass 'Procedures' (Issue 3): https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/notJSON/issues/3
- Planned to parse the xml schemafile into a Python datastructure, specifically the dataclass 'Messages' (Issue 2): https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/notJSON/issues/2

### What I did not do
- I achieved all 3 issues that I planned to do finished by the in-class Sprint 1 demo.

### What problems I encountered
- Only problem I ran into was not understanding .gitignore and removing a directory of node_modules, when I should've just added it to .gitignore

### Issues I worked on
- Write a simple web server in JavaScript: https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/notJSON/issues/26
- Parse XML Schema to Python Datastructure (Procedures): https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/notJSON/issues/3
- Parse XML Schema to Python Datastructure (Messages): https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/notJSON/issues/2

### Files I worked on
- utk-cs340-fall24/notJSON/script.py
- utk-cs340-fall24/notJSON/server.js

### What I accomplished
In this sprint, the meat of what I accomplished exists in the extract_messages and extract_procedures functions of script.py, . I parsed the example XML 
schemafile into specific datatypes using Pyhton algorithms, and once I had the data fully analyzed and separated, I loaded those into Python datastructures 
'Procedures' and 'Messages', like listed before in the issues. Once I parsed the file and built the Messages and Procedures classes, I constructed a few 
print statements that showed the output of the values in these two dataclasses to make sure it was parsing correctly. These print statements were later 
removed for cleanup for our Sprint 1 demo. The final thing I accomplished was developing a JavaScript web server. This was just a simple case to 
understand what we were going to do in future sprints. I wrote JavaScript code using express.js to develop a server on the port and route 
8080/api/hello that simply printed "hello world". This output could be accessed at the link http://localhost:8080/api/hello when server.js is running.
