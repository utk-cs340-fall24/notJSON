Simple server using express.js to be used as we build up our code generation in the future.

For now, will just listen on port 8080 and have a single route /api/hello that responds with "hello world".

To run, have node.js+npm installed, make a directory, initialize a node.js project (command line 'npm init -y'), install express.js, then run 'node server.js'.

You should then see the message "Server is listening on port 8080".


Navigating to "http://localhost:8080/api/hello", you should see "hello world" displayed on the page.
